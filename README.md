# Food-Recipe
I am using spoonacular food API in this project. This API provides thousands of food recipe and details like food information, food nutrients, food ingredients, price & meal types like breakfast, bread, main course, dessert, soup, drink, snack, salad, beverage.
User can search food item by name or meal type. First time user need internet connection for getting food recipes after that this app automatically cached the data to room persistence library.



MVVM design pattern
Live data 
Coroutines, 
Shimmer effect, 
Room persistence library
Diffutil 
Cached data 
Data binding 
Dagger hilt.
